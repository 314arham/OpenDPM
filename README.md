# OpenDPM
This repository was created to handling projects in Discrete Particles Method. This method is used is several scientific field, but here, the focus is on Fluidized Beds.

# about the DPM.py
This code initializes a solid phase with certain number of particles in a gravity field. Particles have interactions and collide perfectly based on equations and scientific proofs from B.P.B Hoomans et al, 1995, Discrete particle simulation of bubble and slug formation in a two-dimensional gas-fluidised bed: A hard-sphere approach.
Further information will be added here.
